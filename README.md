**IronIRC** is a modern IRC client built with the Avalonia UI framework.

This project is in the early stages of development. Many of the changes
that will be appearing will be large and badly documented as the first
step is to port an older, unreleased, WPF-based version of this application
to Avalonia. When that is done, new feature developmetn will begin.
